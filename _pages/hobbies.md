In addition to my academic background, I have had the chance to participate in many activities. To mention a couple of them, I enjoy competitive chess and outdoor activities including hiking, mountain climbing, and other adventures.

I am a <a href="https://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?12888811">US National Master</a>, a title awarded to less than 2% of competitive chess players in the US. Over the course of my competitive career, I have won several state open championships as well as numerous local tournaments.

In graduate school, I took up hiking several hills in California as a nice contrast to the abstract and cerebral nature of research and chess. This eventually led me to the mountains of New Mexico. As of 2025, I have summited some of the highest peaks in New Mexico, including the 13er Wheeler Peak (2x), and the 12ers Deception Peak (2x) and Tesuque Peak. I also completed a Via ferrata ("Iron path" in Italian) for the first time at the Royal Gorge Bridge in Colorado.
