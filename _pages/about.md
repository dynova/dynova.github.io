I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in mathematical biology mentored by [Santiago Schnell](https://faculty-directory.dartmouth.edu/santiago-schnell) in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.dartmouth.edu) at Dartmouth College. I am working on the design & parameter estimation of enzyme-catalyzed experiments, and am also designing a mathematical model of a minimal mechanism for hormesis. I am also collaborating with researchers at Harvard University on an effort involving repeated games with large language models (LLMs).

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Center for Nonlinear Studies](https://cnls.lanl.gov/external//people/Abhishek_Mallela.php) and the [Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group](https://www.lanl.gov/engage/organizations/aldsct/theoretical/tbb) at Los Alamos National Laboratory mentored by [William Hlavacek](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DdpCclEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Yen Ting Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wUhVn34AAAAJ&hl=en). I estimated the basic reproduction number for COVID-19 in 50 US states and 280 urban areas, identifying regions at risk of high disease transmission and aiding future pandemic preparedness.

I earned my doctoral degree from [UC-DAVIS](https://ucdavis.edu/) where I was supervised by [Alan Hastings](https://alanhastings.ucdavis.edu). For my [dissertation research](https://escholarship.org/content/qt1zw5c1ng/qt1zw5c1ng.pdf), I used nonlinear and stochastic modeling approaches to explore how complex systems, including those found in ecology, respond to critical transitions.

Prior to this, I was a Graduate Research Associate in the [Center for Computational Biology](https://compbio.ku.edu/) at the University of Kansas, where I was supervised by [Eric Deeds (now at UCLA)](https://deedslab.ibp.ucla.edu).

I gratefully acknowledge [Naveen Vaidya (now at San Diego State University)](https://nvaidya.sdsu.edu/DiMoLab.html) and [Suzanne Lenhart (at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville)](https://web.math.utk.edu/~slenhart/) for my initial exposure to research in mathematical biology and optimal control theory, during my time as a Master's Student at the [University of Missouri - Kansas City](https://www.umkc.edu).
