Biography ([CV](https://dynova.github.io/files/CV_AbhishekMallela.pdf)) - "What makes me unique?"
======
* I first used Bayesian inference at Los Alamos National Lab to further timely research on COVID-19, then at the University of Notre Dame on the design and parameter estimation of enzyme-catalyzed experiments. I have grown rapidly and thrived in both environments. *These efforts demonstrate my versatile skillset and my strong desire for new opportunities and challenges.*

* Chess has been my lifelong passion. With my achievements as a national chess master and state champion in multiple states (e.g., Texas, Missouri, Kansas, and New Mexico), *I show that I perform well under pressure, have excellent time management skills, and make strategic decisions.*

* Mathematical biology is not easy. I show with my PhD in applied math that *I excel in technical and interdisciplinary fields and the analytical skills I have honed are transferable to other areas.*
