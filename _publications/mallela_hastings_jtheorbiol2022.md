# Abstract 
Invasive species account for incalculable damages worldwide, in both ecological and bioeconomic terms. The question of how a network of invasive populations can be optimally managed is one that deserves further exploration. A study accounting for partial observability and imperfect detection, in particular, could yield useful insights into species eradication efforts. Here, we generalized a simple model system that we developed in previous work. This model consists of three interacting populations with underlying strong Allee effects and stochastic dynamics, inhabiting distinct locations connected by dispersal, which can generate bistability. To explore the stochastic dynamics, we formulated an individual-based modeling approach. Next, using the theory of continuous-time Markov chains, we approximated the original high-dimensional model by a Markov chain with eight states, with each state corresponding to a combination of population thresholds. We then used the reduced model as the core for a powerful decision-making tool, referred to as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Analysis of this POMDP indicates when the system results in optimal management outcomes.
